### Muenster BarcodeDB (modified)

This is a modified version of Muenster BarcodeDB (scaled to 800x600px).
For adjusting SlaRle and testing other JS barcode libraries it was necessary to measure accuracy of detection and localization. 
Due to the horizontal barcode limitation, some images needed to be rotated: 167 images by 90° and 32 by 180°.
